# TSK005: Set Up ReactiveUI Integration

## Description
Set up ReactiveUI integration with Avalonia to enable reactive programming patterns in the application.

## Steps
1. Configure ReactiveUI in the application startup
2. Set up view location mechanism for linking Views and ViewModels
3. Configure ReactiveUI routing
4. Implement activation for ViewModels
5. Set up ReactiveCommand usage pattern
6. Configure WhenAny and observable sequences

## Acceptance Criteria
- ReactiveUI is properly integrated with Avalonia
- View location works correctly
- ReactiveUI routing is configured
- ViewModel activation functions properly
- ReactiveCommand and WhenAny operators work as expected
