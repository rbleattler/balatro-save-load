## Description

Implement a comprehensive error handling system to manage exceptions throughout the application, especially for file operations and platform-specific code. This system should provide consistent error reporting, logging, and user feedback.

## Steps

1. Create an ErrorHandlingService:
   - Implement IErrorHandlingService interface
   - Add methods for different types of errors (File, Network, UI, etc.)
   - Include context information gathering for better debugging

2. Integrate with logging system:
   - Ensure all errors are properly logged with appropriate severity levels
   - Include contextual information in logs (operation type, file paths, etc.)
   - Implement log persistence for later analysis

3. Implement user feedback mechanisms:
   - Create user-friendly error messages
   - Design toast/popup components for error notification
   - Add retry options where appropriate

4. Add global error handling:
   - Implement global exception handlers
   - Create a consistent strategy for error reporting
   - Add telemetry for common errors (optional)

## Acceptance Criteria

- All application errors are properly caught and handled
- Errors are logged with appropriate context for debugging
- Users receive clear, non-technical error messages
- Critical errors are reported in a way that doesn't crash the application
- Error handling is consistent across all platforms

## Dependencies

- TSK003: Configure project properties and target platforms
- TSK004: Add required NuGet packages

## Notes

This task is essential for improving application stability and user experience. Good error handling will make the application more robust and easier to debug when issues occur.

Consider implementing different error handling strategies for development and production environments.
