# Task: TSK008 - Implement Logging System

## Parent User Story

## Description

Implement a comprehensive logging system using Serilog to replace the mock implementation. This system will provide persistent logging across all platforms with different output targets (file, debug console) and proper configuration options.

## Steps

1. Set up Serilog logger:
   - Add Serilog packages (already added in TSK003)
   - Configure log enrichment for consistent context data
   - Implement platform-specific log file paths
   - Add log retention policies

2. Create a proper LogService implementation:
   - Implement ILogService interface using Serilog
   - Add configurable log levels
   - Include proper context data in each log entry
   - Add structured logging support

3. Implement log viewing capabilities:
   - Create a log viewer page
   - Add filtering options (by date, level, source)
   - Include search functionality
   - Add export options

4. Add performance monitoring:
   - Log application performance metrics
   - Track critical operations performance
   - Implement diagnostics logging

## Acceptance Criteria

- Logs are properly persisted to files on each supported platform
- Log rotation and retention policies are in place
- Users can view and filter logs within the application
- Log files can be exported for sharing or analysis
- Performance metrics are available for critical operations
- All application components use the logging system consistently

## Technical Notes

The logging system will replace the MockLogService implemented in TSK007 and provide a proper implementation of the ILogService interface. It will use Serilog for its implementation and provide both file-based and in-memory logging options.

## Dependencies

- TSK007: Implement Error Handling System (completed)
- FT006: Logging System (parent feature)
