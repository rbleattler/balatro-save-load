# TSK008: Set Up Dependency Injection Container

## Description
Set up a dependency injection container for the application using Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection or another appropriate DI framework.

## Steps
1. Add the necessary NuGet packages for dependency injection
2. Create a container configuration in the application startup
3. Set up service collection and service provider
4. Configure service resolution
5. Implement singleton instance management
6. Set up scope management if needed

## Acceptance Criteria
- Dependency injection container is set up and functional
- Services can be registered with the container
- Services can be resolved from the container
- Singleton instances are properly managed
- Container integrates well with the application lifecycle
