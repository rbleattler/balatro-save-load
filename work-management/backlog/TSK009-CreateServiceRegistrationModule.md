# TSK009: Create Service Registration Module

## Description
Create a service registration module to register all application services with the dependency injection container.

## Steps
1. Create service registration extension methods
2. Set up registration for core services
3. Configure service lifetimes (singleton, transient, scoped)
4. Set up registration for platform-specific service implementations
5. Implement conditional service registration based on platform
6. Configure service options where needed

## Acceptance Criteria
- Service registration module is created and functional
- All application services can be registered with the container
- Service lifetimes are correctly configured
- Platform-specific service registration works correctly
- Service registration is modular and maintainable

## Priority
High - Required for proper service management

## Notes
- Group service registrations logically
- Consider using a modular approach for different service categories
