# TSK010: Configure View Resolution

## Description
Configure view resolution through the dependency injection container to automatically resolve views and ViewModels.

## Steps
1. Set up view locator using dependency injection
2. Create view registration mechanism
3. Configure view resolution strategies
4. Implement ViewModel-first navigation with view resolution
5. Set up default view resolution conventions
6. Add support for view model parameter injection

## Acceptance Criteria
- View resolution is configured and working
- Views are automatically resolved for ViewModels
- ViewModel-first navigation works with view resolution
- View resolution follows established conventions
- View parameters can be injected when needed
