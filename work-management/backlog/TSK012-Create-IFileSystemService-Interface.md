# Task: TSK012 - Create IFileSystemService Interface with Core File Operations

## Parent User Story

- [US004 - Implement IFileSystemService Interface](US004-Implement-IFileSystemService-Interface.md)

## Assigned To

[Developer]

## Priority

High (1)

## Estimated Hours

4

## Description

Create a comprehensive IFileSystemService interface that will serve as the foundation for all file operations in the application. This interface should abstract all file system interactions to enable platform-specific implementations while maintaining a consistent API for consumers.

## Steps

1. Define the IFileSystemService interface with methods for:
   - File existence checking (FileExists, DirectoryExists)
   - File reading and writing operations (ReadFile, WriteFile)
   - Directory operations (CreateDirectory, DeleteDirectory, GetFiles, GetDirectories)
   - Path manipulation (CombinePaths, GetDirectoryName, GetFileName, etc.)
   - Platform-specific path resolution (GetBalatroPlatformSavePath, GetApplicationDataPath)
   - File monitoring (WatchFile, UnwatchFile)

2. Add comprehensive XML documentation for each method that clearly defines:
   - Purpose of the method
   - Expected parameters and return values
   - Error handling behavior
   - Platform-specific considerations

3. Define appropriate exception types for file operations:
   - FileAccessException
   - PathNotFoundException
   - PermissionDeniedException

4. Create base helper classes or extension methods that will be useful across implementations

## Acceptance Criteria

- Complete IFileSystemService interface definition with all required methods
- Comprehensive documentation for each method
- Appropriate exception types defined
- Interface methods follow consistent naming and parameter patterns
- Interface properly supports async operations where appropriate
- Method signatures consider all cross-platform requirements

## Dependencies

- None - This is the first task in US004

## Notes

This interface will become the primary way for the application to interact with the file system. Ensure that it's comprehensive enough to handle all file operations needed throughout the application, while still being maintainable and focused on the core functionality.
