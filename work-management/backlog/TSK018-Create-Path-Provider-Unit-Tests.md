## Description

Create comprehensive unit tests for all path provider implementations to ensure they correctly handle platform-specific paths, special folders, and edge cases across different operating systems.

## Steps

1. Create base test infrastructure:
   - Set up mocking framework for file system operations
   - Create test fixtures for different platform scenarios
   - Implement helper methods for path testing

2. Implement Windows path provider tests:
   - Test path resolution for different Windows versions
   - Test special folder resolution
   - Test path normalization and combination
   - Test edge cases (long paths, invalid characters, etc.)
   - Test error handling scenarios

3. Implement macOS path provider tests:
   - Test path resolution for macOS conventions
   - Test special folder resolution
   - Test Unicode normalization handling
   - Test edge cases
   - Test error handling scenarios

4. Implement Linux path provider tests:
   - Test path resolution for Linux conventions
   - Test XDG directory handling
   - Test edge cases
   - Test error handling scenarios

5. Create integration tests that verify proper platform detection:
   - Test that the correct provider is used based on the current platform
   - Test cross-platform path conversion (if applicable)

## Acceptance Criteria

- Comprehensive unit tests for all path provider implementations
- Tests verify correct path resolution for each platform
- Tests verify error handling for edge cases
- Tests can be run on any platform using mocking
- Test coverage meets project standards
- All tests pass

## Dependencies

- TSK015: Create Windows path provider implementation
- TSK016: Create macOS path provider implementation
- TSK017: Create Linux path provider implementation

## Notes

Unit testing path providers can be challenging due to platform-specific behavior. Use appropriate mocking and test fixtures to ensure tests can run on any platform while still verifying platform-specific behavior. Focus on testing the logic rather than the actual file system operations, which should be mocked.
