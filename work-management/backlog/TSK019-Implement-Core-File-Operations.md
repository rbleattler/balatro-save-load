## Parent User Story

- [US006 - Implement File Operations Abstraction](US006-Implement-File-Operations-Abstraction.md)

## Assigned To

High (1)

## Estimated Hours

## Description

Implement the core file operation methods in the FileSystemService that handle reading, writing, copying, moving, and deleting files consistently across all platforms.

## Steps

1. Implement core file read/write operations:
   - ReadAllTextAsync with proper encoding detection
   - ReadAllBytesAsync for binary files
   - WriteAllTextAsync with encoding options
   - WriteAllBytesAsync for binary data
   - AppendAllTextAsync for log files and incremental writes

2. Implement file management operations:
   - CopyFileAsync with overwrite options
   - MoveFileAsync with conflict handling
   - DeleteFileAsync with safety checks
   - RenameFileAsync with name validation

3. Implement directory operations:
   - CreateDirectoryAsync with recursive creation
   - DeleteDirectoryAsync with recursive options
   - GetFilesAsync with pattern matching
   - GetDirectoriesAsync with filtering options

4. Implement file information methods:
   - GetFileInfoAsync for size, dates, attributes
   - GetFileVersionAsync for game save versioning
   - CheckFileAccessAsync for permission verification
   - GetFileHashAsync for integrity checking

## Acceptance Criteria

- All file operations are implemented with proper async/await patterns
- Operations handle platform-specific differences transparently
- Error handling is consistent and informative
- Operations include progress reporting for long-running tasks
- All operations support cancellation
- File operations handle Unicode paths correctly
- Implementation is thoroughly tested across platforms

## Dependencies

- TSK013: Create a base implementation with platform-agnostic functionality

## Notes

The core file operations form the foundation of the application's ability to manage save files. Focus on robustness, error handling, and cross-platform compatibility. Use MAUI's built-in file APIs where possible, but extend them as needed for platform-specific optimizations.
