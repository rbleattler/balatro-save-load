# Task: TSK020 - Create File Operation Error Handling System

## Parent User Story

## Description

Create a comprehensive error handling system for file operations that provides clear, actionable information on failures and handles platform-specific error conditions appropriately.

## Steps

1. Define a hierarchy of file operation exception types:
   - FileSystemException as the base class
   - FileAccessDeniedException for permission issues
   - FileNotFoundException for missing files
   - FileAlreadyExistsException for conflicts
   - DirectoryNotFoundException for missing directories
   - PathTooLongException for path length issues
   - FileInUseException for locked files
   - InvalidFileNameException for naming issues

2. Implement platform-specific error mapping:
   - Map Windows error codes to appropriate exception types
   - Map macOS/Unix error codes to appropriate exception types
   - Handle platform-specific error messages and details

3. Create error recovery strategies:
   - Implement retry logic for transient errors
   - Add timeout handling for blocking operations
   - Create escalation paths for permission issues

4. Implement error logging and reporting:
   - Log all file operation errors with context
   - Include platform-specific details in error reports
   - Create user-friendly error messages

## Acceptance Criteria

- Complete exception hierarchy for file operation errors
- Platform-specific error mapping for accurate error reporting
- Retry mechanisms for transient errors
- Comprehensive error logging
- User-friendly error messages that provide actionable information
- Error handling system is unit tested with different error scenarios

## Dependencies

- TSK019: Implement core file operation methods

## Notes

Robust error handling is critical for file operations, as they interact with the operating system and external resources that can fail in various ways. The error handling system should provide enough information for both users and developers to understand what went wrong and how to fix it.
