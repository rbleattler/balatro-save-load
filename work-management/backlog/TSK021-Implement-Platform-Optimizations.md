## Description

Implement platform-specific optimizations and features for file operations to ensure optimal performance and compatibility on each supported platform.

## Steps

1. Implement Windows-specific optimizations:
   - Use Windows-specific APIs for better performance where needed
   - Handle long path support (>260 chars) with appropriate prefix
   - Implement proper handling of file attributes and NTFS permissions
   - Optimize file copies using Windows copy engines

2. Implement macOS-specific optimizations:
   - Handle resource forks and extended attributes if needed
   - Implement proper Unicode normalization for filenames
   - Support for macOS tags and metadata
   - Handle application bundle paths correctly

3. Implement Linux-specific optimizations:
   - Proper handling of file permissions and ownership
   - Support for symbolic links and hard links
   - Handle special filesystem types (proc, sys, etc.)
   - Implement XDG specification compliance

4. Create platform detection and feature availability system:
   - Detect available platform-specific features at runtime
   - Fallback gracefully when features aren't available
   - Report platform capabilities to higher-level services

## Acceptance Criteria

- Platform-specific implementations correctly optimize file operations
- File operations handle platform-specific features correctly
- Performance is optimized for each platform
- Code gracefully falls back to standard implementations when needed
- Implementation detects and reports platform capabilities
- Optimizations are properly tested on each platform

## Dependencies

- TSK019: Implement core file operation methods
- TSK015: Create Windows path provider implementation
- TSK016: Create macOS path provider implementation
- TSK017: Create Linux path provider implementation

## Notes

While the core file operations should be platform-agnostic, there are cases where using platform-specific APIs can significantly improve performance or enable features not available through the standard APIs. These optimizations should be implemented in a way that maintains the cross-platform API while leveraging platform-specific features when available.
