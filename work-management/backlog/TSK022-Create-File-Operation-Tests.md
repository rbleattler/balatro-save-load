## Description

Create comprehensive unit tests for all file operation implementations to ensure they correctly handle read/write operations, error conditions, and platform-specific behaviors.

## Steps

1. Create test infrastructure for file operations:
   - Set up test file system sandboxes
   - Create mock file system for unit testing
   - Implement test helpers for file comparison and verification

2. Implement read/write operation tests:
   - Test text file reading/writing with different encodings
   - Test binary file reading/writing
   - Test partial reads and writes
   - Test concurrent access patterns

3. Implement file management tests:
   - Test file copy operations with various options
   - Test file move and rename operations
   - Test file deletion with verification
   - Test file attribute and metadata operations

4. Implement error handling tests:
   - Test permission denied scenarios
   - Test file not found scenarios
   - Test file in use/locked scenarios
   - Test invalid path scenarios
   - Test operation cancellation

5. Implement platform-specific tests:
   - Test Windows-specific behaviors
   - Test macOS-specific behaviors
   - Test Linux-specific behaviors

## Acceptance Criteria

- Comprehensive test suite for all file operations
- Tests for normal operation scenarios
- Tests for error handling scenarios
- Tests for platform-specific behaviors
- Tests can be run on any platform using virtualized file system
- All tests pass on the target platforms
- Test coverage meets project standards

## Dependencies

- TSK019: Implement core file operation methods
- TSK020: Create file operation error handling system
- TSK021: Implement platform-specific optimizations for file operations

## Notes

Testing file operations can be challenging due to the need for isolation and platform-specific behaviors. Use appropriate mocking and virtualization techniques to create isolated test environments. Consider using a virtual file system library to simulate different file system scenarios without affecting the actual file system.
