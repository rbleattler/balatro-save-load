# Task: TSK023 - Design File Monitoring Service Interface

## Parent User Story

## Description

Design a comprehensive interface for the file monitoring service that will detect changes to Balatro save files across different platforms.

## Steps

1. Define the IFileMonitoringService interface:
   - Methods for starting and stopping monitoring
   - Configuration options for paths to monitor
   - Event-based notification system for file changes
   - Methods for adding and removing watched paths
   - Filter options for file types and change types

2. Define file change notification models:
   - FileChangeEvent class with change type, path, and time
   - Enumerations for change types (Created, Modified, Deleted, Renamed)
   - Additional metadata for context (size, attributes, etc.)

3. Design throttling and debouncing mechanisms:
   - Configuration for notification frequency
   - Batching options for multiple rapid changes
   - Priority system for different types of changes

4. Create documentation for the interface:
   - Clear descriptions of methods and events
   - Usage examples for common scenarios
   - Platform-specific considerations
   - Performance recommendations

## Acceptance Criteria

- Complete IFileMonitoringService interface definition
- Comprehensive event model for file changes
- Configuration options for monitoring behavior
- Clear documentation with usage examples
- Design considers cross-platform requirements
- Interface is mockable for testing

## Dependencies

- None - This is the first task in US007

## Notes

The interface design should prioritize flexibility and extensibility while keeping the API simple to use. Consider how consumers will register for notifications and how they can filter the types of changes they're interested in.
