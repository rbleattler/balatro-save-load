## Description

Implement platform-specific file watchers that use native APIs to efficiently monitor file system changes on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

## Steps

1. Create base FileWatcher class:
   - Define common functionality for all platforms
   - Implement cross-platform monitoring capabilities
   - Create throttling and debouncing mechanisms
   - Implement resource management for watchers

2. Implement WindowsFileWatcher:
   - Use Windows FileSystemWatcher or Win32 ReadDirectoryChangesW API
   - Handle Windows-specific notification patterns
   - Implement proper error handling for network paths
   - Optimize for NTFS performance

3. Implement MacFileWatcher:
   - Use macOS FSEvents API through native interop
   - Handle macOS-specific notification patterns
   - Implement proper Unicode path normalization
   - Consider package/bundle monitoring specifics

4. Implement LinuxFileWatcher:
   - Use inotify API through native interop
   - Handle Linux-specific notification patterns
   - Implement descriptor limit management
   - Add fallback polling for non-supporting filesystems

5. Create common notification translator:
   - Normalize platform-specific events to common format
   - Implement filtering by file type and event type
   - Create event batching for burst changes
   - Add diagnostic capabilities for monitoring performance

## Acceptance Criteria

- Working file watchers for Windows, macOS, and Linux
- Implementation efficiently uses platform-specific APIs
- File watchers properly detect file creation, modification, deletion, and renaming
- Resource usage is monitored and limited
- Implementation handles errors and edge cases gracefully
- Watchers can be paused, resumed, and reconfigured at runtime
- Implementation properly disposes of system resources

## Dependencies

- TSK023: Design file monitoring service interface

## Notes

File system monitoring behavior varies significantly across platforms. Windows uses a different notification mechanism than macOS and Linux, and there are subtle differences in event semantics. The implementation should normalize these differences while still leveraging platform-specific optimizations.
