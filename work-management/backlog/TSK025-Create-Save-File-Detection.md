# Task: TSK025 - Create Save File Change Detection System

## Parent User Story

- [US007 - Create File Monitoring Service](US007-Create-File-Monitoring-Service.md)

## Assigned To

[Developer]

## Priority

Medium (2)

## Estimated Hours

## Description

Create a specialized system that uses the file monitoring service to detect and interpret changes to Balatro save files, distinguishing between meaningful changes and temporary or partial writes.

## Steps

1. Create SaveFileMonitor class:
   - Build on top of the file monitoring service
   - Add specialized logic for Balatro save file patterns
   - Implement detection of complete vs. partial save file writes
   - Create save file validation to ensure integrity

2. Implement save file change analysis:
   - Detect significant game state changes
   - Track save file versions and timestamps
   - Identify autosaves vs. manual saves
   - Create change summaries for user display

3. Add save file backup triggering:
   - Configure automatic backup on valid save file changes
   - Implement cooldown periods to prevent excessive backups
   - Add prioritization for manual saves over autosaves
   - Create backup verification

4. Implement notification filtering and aggregation:
   - Filter redundant notifications
   - Aggregate related changes
   - Prioritize notifications by importance
   - Add user notification options

## Acceptance Criteria

- Save file monitor correctly detects changes to Balatro save files
- System distinguishes between significant changes and temporary files
- Implementation handles partial writes and file locks correctly
- Change detection integrates with the backup system
- User receives appropriate notifications about save file changes
- System works consistently across all platforms
- Resource usage remains reasonable during monitoring

## Dependencies

- TSK023: Design file monitoring service interface
- TSK024: Implement cross-platform file watchers

## Notes

Balatro creates temporary files during the save process, and the monitoring system needs to detect when a save operation is truly complete. This requires understanding the save file patterns specific to Balatro and implementing logic to detect valid, complete save files.
