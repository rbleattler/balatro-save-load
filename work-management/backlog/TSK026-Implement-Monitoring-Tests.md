# Task: TSK026 - Implement File Monitoring Unit Tests

## Parent User Story

## Assigned To

[Developer]

## Priority

Medium (2)

## Estimated Hours

## Description

Create comprehensive unit tests for the file monitoring service to ensure it correctly detects file changes, handles edge cases, and works consistently across different platforms.

## Steps

1. Create file monitoring test infrastructure:
   - Set up virtual file system for testing
   - Create test fixtures for different monitoring scenarios
   - Implement test helpers for creating file changes
   - Add timing and synchronization utilities

2. Implement file watcher tests:
   - Test detection of file creation events
   - Test detection of file modification events
   - Test detection of file deletion events
   - Test detection of file rename events
   - Test filtering and exclusions

3. Implement save file detection tests:
   - Test detection of valid save file changes
   - Test handling of partial writes and temporary files
   - Test save file validation logic
   - Test backup triggering rules

4. Implement performance and resource tests:
   - Test throttling and debouncing mechanisms
   - Test resource usage during high-frequency changes
   - Test proper cleanup of monitoring resources
   - Test monitoring service under load

5. Implement cross-platform simulation tests:
   - Test Windows-specific notification patterns
   - Test macOS-specific notification patterns
   - Test Linux-specific notification patterns

## Acceptance Criteria

- Comprehensive test suite for the file monitoring service
- Tests cover all notification types and edge cases
- Tests verify proper resource management
- Tests simulate platform-specific behaviors
- Implementation passes all tests on target platforms
- Test coverage meets project standards

## Dependencies

- TSK023: Design file monitoring service interface
- TSK024: Implement cross-platform file watchers
- TSK025: Create save file change detection system

## Notes

Testing file monitoring can be challenging because it depends on file system events that can be hard to simulate reliably. Consider using a virtual file system or mocking framework to create a controlled testing environment. Tests should verify both the functional aspects (correct detection of changes) and non-functional aspects (performance, resource usage).
