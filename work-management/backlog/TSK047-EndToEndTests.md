# Task: End-to-End Testing Implementation

**ID**: TSK047
**Type**: Task
**Status**: Backlog
**Parent**: US001
**Created**: 2025-05-20

## Description

Develop comprehensive end-to-end tests for the application to ensure that all components work together correctly. This will verify that the user flows work as expected and that the application functions correctly across platforms.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Create test scenarios that cover all major user flows
- [ ] Implement automated UI tests using an appropriate framework
- [ ] Test save and restore functionality with actual file operations
- [ ] Verify correct theme switching behavior
- [ ] Test navigation between different views
- [ ] Validate error handling in end-to-end scenarios
- [ ] Run tests on all supported platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux)

## Dependencies

- All core functionality must be implemented
- Unit tests for individual components

## Notes

End-to-end tests will provide confidence that the entire application works as expected, not just individual components. These tests are critical for ensuring cross-platform compatibility and a smooth user experience.
