# US002: MVVM Implementation

## Description
As a developer, I want to implement the MVVM architectural pattern in the Avalonia application so that the codebase is properly structured, testable, and maintainable.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Create base classes for ViewModels
- Implement ReactiveUI integration
- Set up navigation service for view transitions
- Create binding infrastructure
- Implement commands for user interactions instead of direct event handlers
- All UI interactions are properly bound to ViewModel commands

## Tasks
- TSK004: Create Base ViewModel Classes
- TSK005: Set Up ReactiveUI Integration
- TSK006: Implement Navigation Service
- TSK007: Set Up Command Infrastructure

## Parent Feature
- FT001: Project Structure and Architecture Setup

## Status
- **Status**: Backlog
- **Start Date**: Not Started
- **Target Completion**: TBD

## Dependencies
- US001: New Solution Structure

## Priority
High - MVVM architecture is foundational to the new application design
