## Description
As a developer, I want to set up a dependency injection container for the application so that services can be properly registered and consumed throughout the application.

- Register all services with appropriate lifecycles (singleton, transient, scoped)
- Configure view resolution through the DI container
- Implement service location for ViewModels
- Services can be properly injected into ViewModels

## Tasks
- TSK008: Set Up Dependency Injection Container
- TSK009: Create Service Registration Module
- TSK010: Configure View Resolution
- TSK011: Implement Service Location for ViewModels

## Parent Feature

## Status
- **Status**: Backlog
- **Start Date**: Not Started
- **Target Completion**: TBD

## Dependencies
- US001: New Solution Structure
- US002: MVVM Implementation

## Priority
