# User Story: US004 - Implement IFileSystemService Interface

## Parent Feature

- [FT002 - Cross-Platform File System Implementation](../open/FT002-File-System.md)

## Priority

High (1) - Foundation for cross-platform file operations

## Story Points

2

## Description

As a developer, I need to create a well-defined and flexible IFileSystemService interface that abstracts file operations across different platforms so that the application can handle files consistently regardless of the operating system.

## Acceptance Criteria

- IFileSystemService interface is created with methods for:
  - File existence checking
  - File reading and writing
  - Path manipulation
  - Directory operations
  - Platform-specific path resolution
- Interface documentation clearly defines the expected behavior of each method
- Interface design considers needs of both Windows and Unix-based platforms
- Implementation of the interface can be platform-specific without affecting consumers

## Tasks

- TSK012: Create IFileSystemService interface with core file operations
- TSK013: Create a base implementation with platform-agnostic functionality
- TSK014: Document interface method behaviors and contracts

## Technical Notes

The interface should build upon the work done in TSK006 (Platform-Specific File Services) but provide a more comprehensive abstraction specifically for file system operations, paths, and platform-specific concerns.

## Dependencies

- US001: Create MAUI Project Structure (completed)

## Testing

Test cases should verify that:
- Interface contracts are well-defined
- Base implementations follow expected behaviors
- Error cases are properly handled

## Implementation Notes

This interface should use MAUI's built-in file APIs where possible but extend them with platform-specific functionality where necessary.
