# US004: Set Up Platform Detection

## Description
As a developer, I want to implement platform detection so that the application can adapt its behavior based on the operating system it's running on.

## Tasks
- TSK013: Create platform detection service
- TSK014: Implement OS-specific path handling
- TSK015: Configure environment detection for testing
- TSK016: Add platform-specific configurations

## Status
- **Current State**: Backlog
- **Priority**: High (4)

## Parent Work Item
- FT001: Project Setup and Infrastructure

## Acceptance Criteria
- Application can detect Windows, macOS, and Linux environments
- Path handling works correctly across platforms
- Environment-specific configurations are loaded properly
- Platform detection can be mocked for testing

## Definition of Done
- Platform detection works correctly on all target platforms
- Path handling is consistent across platforms
- Testing framework can mock platform detection
- Platform-specific configurations load correctly

## Estimated Effort
- 2 story points

## Dependencies
- US001: Create New Avalonia Solution Structure
- US003: Implement Dependency Injection Framework
