# User Story: US006 - Implement File Operations Abstraction

## Parent Feature

- [FT002 - Cross-Platform File System Implementation](../open/FT002-File-System.md)

## Priority

High (1) - Core functionality for file manipulation

## Story Points

3

## Description

As a developer, I need to implement cross-platform file operation abstractions that handle reading, writing, copying, and deleting files consistently across all supported platforms, so that the application can reliably manage save files regardless of the operating system.

## Acceptance Criteria

- Platform-specific file operation implementations handle:
  - Reading and writing files with proper encoding
  - Copying, moving, and deleting files
  - Creating and managing directories
  - File permissions and access control
- Operations handle asynchronous file access correctly
- Error handling provides clear, actionable information on failures
- Operations handle file locks and concurrency appropriately
- Implementation correctly handles platform-specific file access patterns

## Tasks

- TSK019: Implement core file operation methods
- TSK020: Create file operation error handling system
- TSK021: Implement platform-specific optimizations for file operations
- TSK022: Create file operation unit tests

## Technical Notes

The file operations abstraction should:
- Use async/await patterns for all I/O operations
- Handle different file system behaviors on each platform
- Implement retries for transient errors
- Handle permission issues gracefully
- Support cancel tokens for long-running operations

## Dependencies

- US004: Implement IFileSystemService Interface
- US005: Create Platform-Specific File Path Providers

## Testing

Tests should verify that:
- File operations work correctly on all supported platforms
- Error handling correctly identifies and reports different types of failures
- Concurrent access is handled properly
- Operations can be canceled if needed

## Implementation Notes

File operations should be built on top of the path providers to ensure correct path handling for each platform.
