# User Story: US007 - Create File Monitoring Service

## Parent Feature

- [FT002 - Cross-Platform File System Implementation](../open/FT002-File-System.md)

## Priority

Medium (2) - Important for save file change detection

## Story Points

2

## Description

As a developer, I need to implement a cross-platform file monitoring service that can detect changes to Balatro save files in real-time, so that the application can automatically respond to save file changes made by the game.

## Acceptance Criteria

- File monitoring service detects:
  - New save files being created
  - Existing save files being modified
  - Save files being deleted or renamed
- Service works consistently across Windows, macOS, and Linux
- Monitoring has minimal performance impact
- Service handles temporary files and partial writes correctly
- API provides event-based notification of file changes
- Implementation supports monitoring multiple directories
- Service can be started, stopped, and reconfigured at runtime

## Tasks

- TSK023: Design file monitoring service interface
- TSK024: Implement cross-platform file watchers
- TSK025: Create save file change detection system
- TSK026: Implement file monitoring unit tests

## Technical Notes

The file monitoring service should:
- Use platform-specific file system notification APIs where possible
- Fall back to polling if necessary on platforms without native notification support
- Handle throttling to prevent excessive notifications
- Consider using debouncing for rapid consecutive changes

## Dependencies

- US004: Implement IFileSystemService Interface
- US005: Create Platform-Specific File Path Providers
- US006: Implement File Operations Abstraction

## Testing

Tests should verify that:
- File changes are detected reliably on all platforms
- Service handles rapid consecutive changes correctly
- Resource usage remains reasonable during monitoring
- Service correctly handles edge cases like temporary files

## Implementation Notes

The file monitoring service is crucial for automatically detecting when Balatro creates or updates save files, allowing the tool to react immediately.
