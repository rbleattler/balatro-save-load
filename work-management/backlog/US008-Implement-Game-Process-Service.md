# US008: Implement Game Process Service

## Description
As a developer, I want to implement a game process service so that the application can detect if Balatro is running across different operating systems.

## Tasks
- TSK029: Create IGameProcessService interface
- TSK030: Implement Windows-specific process detection
- TSK031: Implement macOS-specific process detection
- TSK032: Implement Linux-specific process detection

## Status
- **Current State**: Backlog
- **Priority**: High (4)

## Parent Work Item
- FT002: Core Services Implementation

## Acceptance Criteria
- Application can detect if Balatro is running on all platforms
- Process detection is efficient and doesn't consume excessive resources
- Service provides events for game start and exit
- Detection works consistently across platforms

## Definition of Done
- Game detection works on Windows, macOS, and Linux
- Low resource usage for continuous monitoring
- Events fire correctly when game starts or stops
- Unit tests verify core functionality

## Estimated Effort
- 3 story points

## Dependencies
- US003: Implement Dependency Injection Framework
- US004: Set Up Platform Detection
