# TSK001: Create Solution and Project Structure

## Description
Create the new solution and project structure for the Avalonia-based Balatro Save and Load Tool.

## Steps
1. Create a new solution file in the V2 directory
2. Add the following projects to the solution:
   - BalatroSaveToolkit (Main application project)
   - BalatroSaveToolkit.Core (Core library for shared code)
   - BalatroSaveToolkit.Services (Services implementation)
   - BalatroSaveToolkit.Tests (Unit tests project)
3. Set up appropriate directory structure for each project:
   - Models
   - ViewModels
   - Views
   - Services (for interfaces)
4. Add solution items: README, .gitignore, etc.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Solution structure is created with all required projects
- Directory structure follows best practices for Avalonia/MVVM applications
