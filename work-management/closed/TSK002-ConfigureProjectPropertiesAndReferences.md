# TSK002: Configure Project Properties and References

## Description
Configure the project properties and references for all projects in the solution to ensure they target the correct platforms and frameworks.

## Steps
1. Configure all projects to target .NET 8.0 (since .NET 9.0 is not yet available)
2. Set up appropriate target frameworks for cross-platform support:
   - Windows
   - macOS
   - Linux
3. Configure assembly information
4. Set up project references between projects
5. Configure build properties
6. Set up runtime identifiers for platform-specific builds

## Acceptance Criteria
- All projects target .NET 8.0
- Projects are configured for cross-platform support
- Project references are correctly set up
- Solution builds without errors

## Priority
Highest - Required for project configuration

## Notes
- Configured runtime identifiers: win-x64, osx-x64, linux-x64
- Added Directory.Build.props for consistent properties across projects
- Configured assembly information and version numbers
- Set up project metadata and descriptions

## Implementation Notes
- Added RuntimeIdentifiers property to main project
- Set up PublishSingleFile and PublishTrimmed for release builds
- Added consistent version information across all projects
- Added application icons
- Created Directory.Build.props for shared properties
