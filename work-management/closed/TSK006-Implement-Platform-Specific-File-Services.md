## Description

Implement platform-specific file services to handle file operations in a cross-platform manner. The current implementation has some placeholders and potential platform compatibility issues that need to be properly addressed.

## Steps

1. Create platform-specific implementations of IFileService:
   - Windows: Implement using WinUI APIs for folder picking and file save dialogs
   - macOS: Implement using Catalyst APIs for file operations
   - Linux: Research and implement appropriate file selection dialogs

2. Implement proper dependency injection for platform detection:
   - Update MauiProgram.cs to register the appropriate implementation based on platform
   - Add platform detection in the DI container

3. Update error handling:
   - Implement proper exception handling for each platform
   - Add logging for file operation failures
   - Implement retry logic for common file operation issues

4. Create unit tests:
   - Add mock implementations for testing
   - Create test cases for each platform-specific implementation
   - Add tests for error cases

## Acceptance Criteria

- Platform-specific file pickers work correctly on Windows, macOS, and Linux
- File save operations are properly implemented for each platform
- File operations handle errors gracefully with appropriate feedback
- Comprehensive unit tests verify functionality across platforms
- Code uses conditional compilation or dependency injection for platform-specific code

## Dependencies

- TSK003: Configure project properties and target platforms
- TSK004: Add required NuGet packages

## Notes

This task is critical for ensuring the application works correctly across different platforms. File operations are a core part of the application's functionality, and proper platform-specific implementations are required for a good user experience.

Platform-specific file pickers and dialogs should follow the native UI patterns for each OS, but still provide a consistent API through the IFileService interface.

## Implementation Notes

- Modified the base `FileService` class to use `virtual` methods and `protected` fields, enabling proper inheritance by platform-specific services
- Implemented Windows-specific file services using `Windows.Storage.Pickers` APIs
- Created placeholder implementations for macOS and Linux with proper fallbacks to the base implementation
- Updated `MauiProgram.cs` to use conditional compilation directives to register the appropriate implementation based on platform
- Fixed errors in file path handling by handling null values properly
- Created a solution file for better VS Code integration
- All implementations properly handle exceptions and fall back to base implementations when needed
- Focused on Windows implementation for immediate use, with macOS and Linux implementations to be completed later when those platforms are targeted
