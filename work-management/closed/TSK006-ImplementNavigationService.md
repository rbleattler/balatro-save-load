# TSK006: Implement Navigation Service

## Description

Implement a navigation service for handling view transitions and navigation between different parts of the application.

## Steps

1. ✅ Create an `INavigationService` interface
2. ✅ Implement the navigation service using ReactiveUI's routing capabilities
3. ✅ Set up view registration in the navigation service
4. ✅ Implement navigation methods (Navigate, GoBack, etc.)
5. ✅ Add support for navigation parameters
6. ✅ Configure navigation history management

## Acceptance Criteria

- ✅ Navigation service is implemented and functional
- ✅ Views can be registered with the navigation service
- ✅ Navigation between views works correctly
- ✅ Parameters can be passed during navigation
- ✅ Navigation history is properly managed

## Parent User Story

- US002: MVVM Implementation

## Status

- **Status**: ✅ Completed (superseded by TSK050)
- **Start Date**: 2025-05-19
- **Completion Date**: 2024-12-28
- **Superseded By**: TSK050 - Consolidate Navigation Services

## Dependencies

- TSK004: Create Base ViewModel Classes
- TSK005: Set Up ReactiveUI Integration

## Priority

Medium - Required for multi-view application navigation

## Notes

- ✅ Navigation service is testable through proper dependency injection
- ✅ Modal and non-modal navigation scenarios are supported through ReactiveUI routing
- ✅ Task was completed as part of TSK050 - Consolidate Navigation Services
- ✅ ReactiveUI-based approach provides better integration with MVVM architecture

## Implementation Summary

This task was completed as part of TSK050. The navigation system has been successfully implemented with:

- **INavigationService Interface**: Located in `BalatroSaveToolkit.Core.Services.INavigationService`
- **ReactiveUI Implementation**: Located in `BalatroSaveToolkit.Services.Navigation.NavigationService`
- **Proper DI Registration**: Configured in `NavigationServiceExtensions` and `App.axaml.cs`
- **Full Method Support**: NavigateToAsync, NavigateBackAsync, ClearHistoryAsync, NavigateToInitialViewAsync
- **Observable Properties**: CurrentViewModel and CanNavigateBack observables
