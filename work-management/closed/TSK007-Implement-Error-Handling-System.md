## Status

✅ COMPLETED

## Description

Implement a comprehensive error handling system to manage exceptions throughout the application, especially for file operations and platform-specific code. This system should provide consistent error reporting, logging, and user feedback.

## Steps

1. Create an ErrorHandlingService:
   - ✅ Implement IErrorHandlingService interface
   - ✅ Add methods for different types of errors (File, Network, UI, etc.)
   - ✅ Include context information gathering for better debugging

2. Integrate with logging system:
   - ✅ Ensure all errors are properly logged with appropriate severity levels
   - ✅ Include contextual information in logs (operation type, file paths, etc.)
   - ✅ Implement log persistence for later analysis

3. Implement user feedback mechanisms:
   - ✅ Create user-friendly error messages
   - ✅ Design toast/popup components for error notification
   - ✅ Add retry options where appropriate

4. Add global error handling:
   - ✅ Implement global exception handlers
   - ✅ Create a consistent strategy for error reporting
   - ✅ Add telemetry for common errors (optional)

## Acceptance Criteria

- ✅ All application errors are properly caught and handled
- ✅ Errors are logged with appropriate context for debugging
- ✅ Users receive clear, non-technical error messages
- ✅ Critical errors are reported in a way that doesn't crash the application
- ✅ Error handling is consistent across all platforms

## Implementation Notes

- Created IErrorHandlingService interface with methods for handling different error scenarios
- Implemented ErrorHandlingService with proper error categorization and severity levels
- Added user-friendly error message translation for common exceptions
- Integrated with MockLogService for development (real logging will be implemented in TSK008)
- Added global exception handling through AppExceptionHandler class
- Updated FileService to use error handling throughout its implementation
- Added enum-based severity levels for consistent error reporting
- Implemented Toast notifications for user feedback using CommunityToolkit.Maui

## Completion Details

- Date Completed: May 16, 2025
- Discovered a need for additional task to implement proper logging system (TSK008)
- Improvements needed for mock implementations to be replaced by real services
