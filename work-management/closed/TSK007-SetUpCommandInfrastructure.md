# TSK007: Set Up Command Infrastructure

## Description
Set up the command infrastructure for the application using ReactiveUI's ReactiveCommand to handle user interactions.

## Steps
1. Create helper methods for common command creation patterns
2. Set up command execution and can-execute functionality
3. Implement async command support
4. Create mechanisms for command parameter passing
5. Set up error handling for commands
6. Implement command result handling

## Acceptance Criteria
- Command infrastructure is set up and functional
- ReactiveCommands can be easily created and used in ViewModels
- Async commands work correctly
- Command parameters can be passed and used
- Error handling is properly implemented for commands
