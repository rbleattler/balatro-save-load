## Description

Create a base FileSystemService implementation that contains platform-agnostic functionality from the IFileSystemService interface. This implementation will serve as the foundation for platform-specific implementations while providing common functionality that works across all platforms.

## Steps

1. Create a BaseFileSystemService class that implements IFileSystemService:
   - Use MAUI's FileSystem APIs for cross-platform operations where possible
   - Implement platform-agnostic file operations (reading, writing, etc.)
   - Use proper error handling and logging for all operations
   - Create virtual methods for operations that may need platform-specific overrides

2. Implement common utility methods:
   - Path combination and normalization
   - Standard directory handling
   - File reading and writing with proper encoding handling
   - Error handling and translation to appropriate exception types

3. Add proper unit test support:
   - Create appropriate abstractions to allow mocking of file system operations
   - Ensure testability of the implementation

4. Implement robust error handling:
   - Convert system exceptions to application-specific exceptions
   - Add logging for file operation failures
   - Provide meaningful error messages

## Acceptance Criteria

- BaseFileSystemService implements all interface methods
- Platform-agnostic operations work correctly across platforms
- Virtual methods are properly marked for overriding in platform-specific implementations
- All methods include proper error handling and logging
- Methods that should be async are implemented using Task-based asynchronous pattern
- Implementation follows SOLID principles

## Dependencies

- TSK012: Create IFileSystemService interface with core file operations

## Notes

The base implementation should focus on functionality that is truly platform-agnostic. Operations that need significant platform-specific logic should be marked as virtual and implemented with default behavior that works reasonably across platforms, expecting to be overridden by platform-specific implementations.
