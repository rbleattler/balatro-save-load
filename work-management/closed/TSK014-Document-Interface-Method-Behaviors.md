# Task: TSK014 - Document Interface Method Behaviors and Contracts

## Parent User Story

- [US004 - Implement IFileSystemService Interface](US004-Implement-IFileSystemService-Interface.md)

## Assigned To

[Developer]

## Priority

Medium (2)

## Estimated Hours

## Description

Create comprehensive documentation for the IFileSystemService interface that clearly explains the expected behavior, contracts, and platform-specific considerations for each method. This documentation will help developers understand how to use the interface correctly and implement it for different platforms.

## Steps

1. Document behavior contracts for each interface method:
   - Precise description of method purpose
   - Expected input validation
   - Return value guarantees
   - Exception scenarios and types
   - Thread safety considerations
   - Async operation guarantees

2. Create platform-specific notes for each method:
   - Windows-specific behaviors or limitations
   - macOS-specific behaviors or limitations
   - Linux-specific behaviors or limitations
   - Common pitfalls or considerations

3. Document integration patterns:
   - Common usage patterns
   - Examples of correct usage
   - Integration with other services
   - Proper dependency injection

4. Create developer guidelines:
   - Best practices for implementation
   - Testing recommendations
   - Performance considerations

## Acceptance Criteria

- Complete XML documentation for IFileSystemService interface and methods
- Supplementary markdown documentation file with detailed usage examples
- Platform-specific considerations documented for each method
- Common implementation patterns and integration examples provided
- Documentation follows project documentation standards

## Dependencies

- TSK012: Create IFileSystemService interface with core file operations

## Notes

Good documentation is essential for interface contracts, especially for cross-platform functionality. This task ensures that the interface design is well-thought-out and that all developers can understand how to use and implement it correctly.
