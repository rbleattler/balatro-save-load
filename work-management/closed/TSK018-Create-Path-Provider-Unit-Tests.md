## Description

Create comprehensive unit tests for all path provider implementations to ensure they correctly handle platform-specific paths, special folders, and edge cases across different operating systems.

## Steps

1. Create base test infrastructure:
   - Set up mocking framework for file system operations ✅
   - Create test fixtures for different platform scenarios ✅
   - Implement helper methods for path testing ✅

2. Implement Windows path provider tests:
   - Test path resolution for different Windows versions ✅
   - Test special folder resolution ✅
   - Test path normalization and combination ✅
   - Test edge cases (long paths, invalid characters, etc.) ✅
   - Test error handling scenarios ✅

3. Implement macOS path provider tests:
   - Test path resolution for macOS conventions ✅
   - Test special folder resolution ✅
   - Test Unicode normalization handling ✅
   - Test edge cases ✅
   - Test error handling scenarios ✅

4. Implement Linux path provider tests:
   - Test path resolution for Linux conventions ✅
   - Test XDG directory handling ✅
   - Test edge cases ✅
   - Test error handling scenarios ✅

5. Create integration tests that verify proper platform detection:
   - Test that the correct provider is used based on the current platform ✅
   - Test cross-platform path conversion (if applicable) ✅

## Completion Notes

1. Created a comprehensive file system mocking infrastructure:
   - Implemented `FileSystemMock` class to simulate file system operations
   - Created interfaces for abstracting `File`, `Directory`, and `Environment` operations
   - Implemented path normalization for different platforms

2. Created test fixtures for platform-specific testing:
   - Base test fixture with shared functionality
   - Windows-specific test fixture
   - macOS-specific test fixture
   - Linux-specific test fixture

3. Implemented comprehensive test suites for all path providers:
   - Windows path provider tests with 20+ test cases
   - macOS path provider tests with 20+ test cases
   - Linux path provider tests with 25+ test cases
   - Path provider factory tests for platform detection

4. Used reflection to access private methods for thorough testing of implementation details

5. Testing coverage includes:
   - Path normalization and character handling
   - Home directory resolution
   - Special folder path mapping
   - Steam installation detection
   - XDG directory handling (Linux)
   - Unicode normalization (macOS)
   - Long path handling (Windows)
   - Platform-specific path conventions

All tests can be run cross-platform due to the mock file system infrastructure that simulates the behavior of each platform's file system without requiring the actual platform to be present.

## Dependencies

- TSK015: Create Windows path provider implementation
- TSK016: Create macOS path provider implementation
- TSK017: Create Linux path provider implementation

## Notes

Unit testing path providers can be challenging due to platform-specific behavior. The implemented mock framework allows tests to run on any platform while still verifying platform-specific behavior.
