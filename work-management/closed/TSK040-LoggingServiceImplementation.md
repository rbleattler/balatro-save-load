## Description

Implement a comprehensive logging service to record application events, errors, and diagnostic information. This service will provide structured logging capabilities with different severity levels and will replace the current ad-hoc logging approaches.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Define an ILoggingService interface with appropriate methods for different log levels
- [x] Create a LoggingService implementation that supports Debug, Info, Warning, and Error levels
- [x] Replace all Debug.WriteLine calls with proper logging service calls
- [x] Ensure log messages include appropriate context information
- [x] Set up dependency injection for the logging service
- [x] Make logging service available throughout the application
- [x] Create extension methods for easy logging integration

## Implementation Details

- Created `ILoggingService` interface in Core project
- Implemented `LoggingService` in Services project
- Added extension methods for convenient logging
- Set up DI registration in App.axaml.cs
- Replaced all debug prints with structured logging
- Added proper exception handling with detailed logging

## Notes

The logging service provides a foundation for better diagnostics and troubleshooting. It can be extended in the future to support additional logging providers like file-based logging or external logging services.
