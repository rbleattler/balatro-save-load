## Description

Implement a notification service to provide user-friendly feedback about application operations and errors. This will include toast notifications, confirmation dialogs, and other user feedback mechanisms.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Implement confirmation dialog functionality for destructive operations
- [x] Ensure notifications follow the application theme
- [x] Integrate notification service with ViewModels and services
- [x] Set up dependency injection for the notification service
- [x] Create mock implementation for testing

## Implementation Details
