## Description

Consolidate the three platform-specific game process detector implementations (Windows, macOS, Linux) into a single cross-platform implementation using System.Diagnostics.Process for improved maintainability and reliability.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Create unified GameProcessDetector using System.Diagnostics.Process
- [x] Remove platform-specific detector classes
- [x] Implement self-detection prevention
- [x] Handle LÖVE engine process detection
- [x] Test functionality across platforms
- [x] Maintain interface compliance with IGameProcessService
- [x] Preserve all existing functionality
- [x] Update documentation

## Changes Made

### Code Changes

- Created unified GameProcessDetector class using System.Diagnostics.Process
- Added IsOwnToolkitProcess() for self-detection prevention
- Implemented IsLoveProcessRunningBalatro() for LÖVE engine support
- Simplified GameProcessService to use unified detector
- Removed WindowsProcessDetector.cs, MacOsProcessDetector.cs, LinuxProcessDetector.cs

### Benefits

- Reduced code complexity by eliminating ~300 lines of platform-specific code
- Improved maintainability with single codebase
- Enhanced reliability with unified error handling
- Better performance using .NET's built-in process enumeration
- Consistent behavior across all platforms

## Dependencies

- TSK029: Create IGameProcessService interface
- TSK030: Implement Windows-specific process detection
- TSK031: Implement macOS-specific process detection
- TSK032: Implement Linux-specific process detection

## Notes

The unified implementation maintains all functionality while significantly reducing complexity and improving cross-platform reliability. Build passes with only code quality warnings unrelated to game detection.
