## Description

Clean up unused files and code to improve maintainability

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] BalatroSaveToolkit.UI directory removed (not present in project structure)
- [x] Unused wrapper views evaluated (SaveContentPageView and ThemeSettingsPageView are properly integrated with ReactiveUI navigation)
- [x] Unused code removed (backup .bak files were removed)
- [x] Build succeeds after cleanup


## Implementation Notes

1. Confirmed through code inspection that the wrapper views ThemeSettingsPageView and SaveContentPageView are properly integrated with ReactiveUI navigation:
   - SaveContentPageViewModel is used in DashboardViewModel for navigation
   - ThemeSettingsPageViewModel is used in MainWindowViewModel for navigation
   - Both are properly used with their respective views

2. Removed the following backup files which were no longer needed:
   - d:\Repos\balatro-save-load\V2\BalatroSaveToolkit\Views\SaveContentPageView.axaml.bak
   - d:\Repos\balatro-save-load\V2\BalatroSaveToolkit\App.axaml.cs.bak
   - d:\Repos\balatro-save-load\V2\BalatroSaveToolkit.sln.bak

3. Verified that the BalatroSaveToolkit.UI directory is not present in the codebase.

4. Successfully built the solution to confirm no breaking changes were introduced.
