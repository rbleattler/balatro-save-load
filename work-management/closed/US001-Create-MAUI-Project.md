# User Story: US001 - Create MAUI Project Structure

## Parent Feature

- [FT001 - Project Setup and Core Architecture](FT001-Project-Setup.md)

## Priority

High (1) - Foundational step for the entire project

## Story Points

3

## Status

✅ COMPLETED

## Description

As a developer, I need to set up a new .NET MAUI project with the appropriate structure so that I can begin migrating the application from WPF.

## Acceptance Criteria

- ✅ New MAUI project is created targeting .NET 9
- ✅ Project structure includes folders for Views, ViewModels, Models, and Services
- ✅ Basic app resources are set up (icons, splash screen, etc.)
- ✅ Project builds successfully with no errors
- ✅ Basic AppShell structure is created

## Tasks

- [x] TSK001: Create new .NET MAUI project using the latest SDK
- [x] TSK002: Set up folder structure (Views, ViewModels, Models, Services)
- [x] TSK003: Configure project properties and target platforms
- [x] TSK004: Add required NuGet packages (completed)
- [x] TSK005: Create basic resources (icons, splash) (completed with default resources)
- [ ] TSK006: Implement Platform-Specific File Services (new task added to backlog)
- [ ] TSK007: Implement Error Handling System (new task added to backlog)

## Technical Notes

```csharp
// Implemented structure for MauiProgram.cs
public static class MauiProgram
{
    public static MauiApp CreateMauiApp()
    {
        var builder = MauiApp.CreateBuilder();
        builder
            .UseMauiApp<App>()
            .UseMauiCommunityToolkit()
            .ConfigureFonts(fonts =>
            {
                fonts.AddFont("OpenSans-Regular.ttf", "OpenSansRegular");
                fonts.AddFont("OpenSans-Semibold.ttf", "OpenSansSemibold");
            });

        // Services registered with proper dependency injection
        builder.Services.AddSingleton<IFileService, FileService>();
        builder.Services.AddSingleton<ILogService, MockLogService>();
        builder.Services.AddSingleton<ISettingsService, MockSettingsService>();
        builder.Services.AddSingleton<IGameProcessService, MockGameProcessService>();
        builder.Services.AddSingleton<ISaveService, MockSaveService>();

        // ViewModels registered
        builder.Services.AddSingleton<MainViewModel>();
        builder.Services.AddSingleton<DashboardViewModel>();

        return builder.Build();
    }
}
```

## Dependencies

None - This is the first user story to complete

## Testing

- ✅ Verified project builds successfully
- ✅ Configured Windows as the primary target platform
- ✅ Added configurations for macOS and Linux (to be enabled later)

## Implementation Notes

- Added proper nullable reference type handling throughout the project
- Fixed file service implementation to use correct MAUI APIs
- Added proper error handling for file operations
- Created GlobalUsings.cs for consistent imports
- Added two new tasks (TSK006 and TSK007) to improve cross-platform support and error handling
- Project now follows MVVM pattern with dependency injection

## Completion Details

- Date Completed: May 16, 2025
- Primary implementer: Developer
- Key accomplishments:
  - Set up MAUI project structure
  - Implemented MVVM architecture
  - Created service interfaces and implementations
  - Fixed cross-platform compatibility issues
  - Added error handling for file operations
