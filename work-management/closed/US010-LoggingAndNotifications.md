## Description

As a user, I want meaningful feedback during application operations so that I can understand what is happening and receive guidance when errors occur.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Implement a logging service to record application events and errors
- [x] Create a notification service to display user-friendly messages
- [x] Add confirmation dialogs for potentially destructive operations
- [x] Ensure notifications follow the application theme (light/dark)
- [x] Implement error handling with user-friendly messages
- [x] Create mock implementations for testing

## Child Work Items

- TSK040 ✓ (Logging Service Implementation)
- TSK041 ✓ (Notification Service Implementation)
- TSK045 (Enhanced User Feedback System)

## Notes

The logging and notification systems are critical for providing good user experience and debugging capabilities. This will improve user confidence in the application and make troubleshooting easier for developers.
