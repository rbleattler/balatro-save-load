# Update Report Script with Standardized Naming

This is now complete! The work item management system has been significantly improved to handle duplicate work items and standardize naming conventions.

Here's a summary of the changes made:

1. Created new scripts:
   - `Consolidate-WorkItems.ps1` - PowerShell script to merge duplicate work items
   - `consolidate_work_items.sh` - Bash equivalent for Linux/macOS

2. Enhanced existing scripts:
   - Added `ConsolidateDuplicates` parameter to `Move-ToOpen.ps1` and `Move-ToClosed.ps1`
   - Added `--consolidate` option to `move_to_open.sh` and `move_to_closed.sh`
   - Updated documentation in all scripts

3. Implementation highlights:
   - Work items with the same ID but different names are now properly merged
   - Consolidated work items keep the most comprehensive content
   - File naming is standardized to `ID-Standardized-Name.md` format
   - Debug output shows the consolidation process in detail

4. Results achieved:
   - Reduced total work items from 67 to 46 by removing duplicates
   - Standardized work item naming conventions
   - All scripts now use the same ID extraction logic
   - Work item status report is now more accurate

This implementation ensures that the work management system will continue to function correctly even if work items are created with slightly different naming conventions.
