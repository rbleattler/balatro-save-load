## Description

Set up the complete folder structure for the MAUI project following MVVM pattern. This includes creating necessary Views, ViewModels, Models, and Services folders with appropriate base classes and interfaces.

## Steps

1. Create Views folder structure:
   - Main Views (Dashboard, Settings, etc.)
   - Common UI components (Loading, Dialogs)
   - Create placeholder XAML files for main views

2. Organize ViewModels folder:
   - Ensure BaseViewModel is properly implemented
   - Create placeholder ViewModels for main views

3. Set up Models folder:
   - Core data models
   - DTOs (Data Transfer Objects)
   - Create basic model classes needed for the application

4. Configure Services folder:
   - Common service interfaces
   - Platform-specific implementations
   - Create necessary service registration in DI container

5. Create base UI controls and templates in Resources folder

## Acceptance Criteria

- Complete folder structure is created following MVVM pattern
- Base classes for each component type are implemented
- Navigation structure between views is configured
- Placeholder implementations for main application views
- Project compiles successfully after changes

## Dependencies

- TSK001: Create new .NET MAUI project using the latest SDK

## Notes

Ensure the folder structure aligns with best practices for MAUI applications and supports the cross-platform requirements of the project.
