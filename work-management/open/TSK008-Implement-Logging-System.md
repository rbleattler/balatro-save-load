## Status

✅ COMPLETED

## Description

Implement a comprehensive logging system using Serilog to replace the mock implementation. This system will provide persistent logging across all platforms with different output targets (file, debug console) and proper configuration options.

## Steps

1. Set up Serilog logger:
   - ✅ Add Serilog packages (already added in TSK003)
   - ✅ Configure log enrichment for consistent context data
   - ✅ Implement platform-specific log file paths
   - ✅ Add log retention policies

2. Create a proper LogService implementation:
   - ✅ Implement ILogService interface using Serilog
   - ✅ Add configurable log levels
   - ✅ Include proper context data in each log entry
   - ✅ Add structured logging support

3. Implement log viewing capabilities:
   - ✅ Create a log viewer page
   - ✅ Add filtering options (by date, level, source)
   - ✅ Include search functionality
   - ✅ Add export options

4. Add performance monitoring:
   - ✅ Log application performance metrics
   - ✅ Track critical operations performance
   - ✅ Implement diagnostics logging

## Acceptance Criteria

- ✅ Logs are properly persisted to files on each supported platform
- ✅ Log rotation and retention policies are in place
- ✅ Users can view and filter logs within the application
- ✅ Log files can be exported for sharing or analysis
- ✅ Performance metrics are available for critical operations
- ✅ All application components use the logging system consistently

## Technical Notes

The logging system replaces the MockLogService with a proper implementation using Serilog. It provides both file-based and in-memory logging options with the following features:

- Log rotation based on file size (10MB) and time (daily)
- Retention of 10 most recent log files
- Rich context data including source, timestamp, and severity
- Both text and JSON formatted logs for different analysis scenarios
- In-memory cache of recent logs for fast access
- Ability to parse historical logs from files when needed
- User interface for searching, filtering, and viewing logs
- Export capability for sharing logs with support
- Log detail popup for viewing full log context including stack traces

## Dependencies

- TSK007: Implement Error Handling System (completed)
- FT006: Logging System (parent feature)

## Completion Details

- **Date Completed**: May 16, 2025
- **Implementation Notes**:
  - Implemented Serilog with file and debug sinks
  - Created LogService with proper file management and retention policies
  - Added LogsPage and LogsViewModel for viewing and filtering logs
  - Implemented LogDetailPopup for viewing detailed log information
  - Updated MauiProgram.cs to register LogService and related components
  - Integrated with FileSaver for exporting logs
  - Added AppShell navigation for the logs page

- **Future Enhancements**:
  - Add crash reporting to external services
  - Implement remote logging for support scenarios
  - Add more granular log filtering options
  - Create log analytics for troubleshooting common issues

## Estimate vs. Actual

- Estimated: 4 hours
- Actual: 4.5 hours
- Variance: +0.5 hours due to additional UI implementation for log detail popup
