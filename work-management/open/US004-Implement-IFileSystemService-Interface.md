# User Story: US004 - Implement IFileSystemService Interface

## Parent Feature

- [FT002 - File System](FT002-File-System.md)

## Priority

High

## Estimate

8 hours

## Description

As a developer, I need a robust and cross-platform file system service that can handle all file operations required by the application. This service should abstract away platform-specific details while providing a common interface for file access, monitoring, and manipulation.

## Acceptance Criteria

- A complete implementation of IFileSystemService is available
- The implementation works across all target platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- The service handles all file system operations with proper error handling
- Platform-specific operations are properly abstracted
- File monitoring is supported
- All file operations are asynchronous where appropriate

## Tasks

- [x] [TSK012 - Create IFileSystemService Interface](../closed/TSK012-Create-IFileSystemService-Interface.md)
- [x] [TSK013 - Create Base FileSystemService Implementation](../closed/TSK013-Create-Base-FileSystemService-Implementation.md)
- [ ] [TSK014 - Implement Windows FileSystemService](../backlog/TSK014-Implement-Windows-FileSystemService.md)
- [ ] [TSK015 - Implement macOS FileSystemService](../backlog/TSK015-Implement-macOS-FileSystemService.md)
- [ ] [TSK016 - Implement Linux FileSystemService](../backlog/TSK016-Implement-Linux-FileSystemService.md)
- [ ] [TSK017 - Create Tests for FileSystemService](../backlog/TSK017-Create-Tests-for-FileSystemService.md)

## Notes

- The implementation should leverage MAUI's built-in file system APIs where possible
- Consider using a "chain of responsibility" pattern for platform-specific overrides
- File monitoring is critical for the save file watcher functionality
- The service should integrate with the logging system for debugging and error reporting
