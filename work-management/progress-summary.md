# Balatro Save and Load Tool Migration - Progress Summary

## Completed Work

### Setup and Infrastructure

- Created solution structure with proper projects
- Configured Avalonia references
- Set up framework for cross-platform targeting
- Configured ReactiveUI integration
- Implemented application initialization and bootstrapping
- Established ViewLocator for dynamic view resolution

### Core Services

- Defined IFileSystemService interface and implementation
- Implemented platform-specific FileSystemService classes for:
  - Windows
  - macOS
  - Linux
- Added file watching capabilities
- Implemented save file discovery logic
- Defined ISettingsService interface
- Implemented JSON-based settings storage and retrieval
- Added logging service with different log levels
- Implemented notification service with toast notifications and confirmation dialogs

### Settings Service ✓

- Interface defined and implemented
- JSON-based settings storage implemented
- Settings loading and saving functionality working

### Theme Service ✓

- Interface defined
- Implementation complete
- Platform-specific theme detection implemented for Windows, macOS and Linux
- Theme resource dictionaries created for Avalonia
- Theme system integration with application
- Dark/Light theme switching functionality
- System theme following capability

### Game Process Service ✓

- Interface defined
- Implementation complete
- Platform-specific process detection implemented for Windows, macOS and Linux
- Process change events implemented
- Game status monitoring

### Navigation Service ✓

- Interface defined (INavigationService)
- Implementation complete using ReactiveUI routing
- ViewStackService for view management
- ViewModelBase created for routable ViewModels
- MainViewModel screen host implemented
- ViewLocator for mapping ViewModels to Views
- Sample ViewModels created (DashboardViewModel, ThemeSettingsViewModel)
- DI registration using Splat

### View Models

- MainWindowViewModel implementing IScreen for routing
- DashboardViewModel as initial view with save file management
- ThemeSettingsViewModel for theme configuration
- SaveFileViewModel with property change notifications for derived properties
- ViewModelBase for common functionality
- ReactiveUI integration with MVVM patterns

### Views

- Basic view structure established
- ReactiveUI view integration
- View activation handlers
- Toast notification support
- Confirmation dialog integration

### Testing Infrastructure

- Created MockFileSystemService for testing file operations
- Implemented MockNotificationService for testing notifications
- Added unit tests for ViewModels
- Added unit tests for service implementations

## Next Steps

1. Complete the UI views implementation (in progress)
   - DashboardView has been updated with XAML for game status and save file listings
   - Styling has been implemented to match the application theme
   - Theme resources have been expanded to support UI components
2. Enhance user feedback system with progress indicators
3. Implement SaveContentViewer functionality
4. Add end-to-end testing for cross-platform validation

- Implement TSK045 - Enhanced user feedback with progress indicators
- Implement TSK046 - SaveContentViewer functionality
- Implement TSK047 - End-to-end testing
- Update US001 once all related tasks are complete

## Notes

- All implementations have been made cross-platform
- FileSystemService handles platform-specific paths and behaviors
- Theme system is fully implemented with dark/light modes and system theme detection
- Navigation system implemented using ReactiveUI routing
- Project structure follows MVVM pattern with proper separation of concerns
- Dependency injection is configured using Splat
- Fixed compiler warnings by:
  - Replacing general exception catching with specific exception types
  - Adding proper null handling for nullable references
  - Using logging service instead of Debug.WriteLine
  - Adding suppression attributes for reflection warnings when needed
- Logging system implemented with proper abstraction for future extensions
- Notification service provides user feedback with toast notifications
- Confirmation dialogs added for potentially destructive operations
- Unit tests implemented for core functionality
- Mock services created for testability
