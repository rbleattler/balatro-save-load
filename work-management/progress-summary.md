## Recent Code Fixes

1. Completed codebase cleanup (TSK050):
   - Removed backup files (.bak) that were no longer needed
   - Evaluated wrapper views (SaveContentPageView, ThemeSettingsPageView) and confirmed they are properly integrated with ReactiveUI navigation
   - Verified no BalatroSaveToolkit.UI directory exists in the codebase
   - Confirmed build succeeds after cleanup

2. Addressed code analysis warnings (TSK049):
   - Marked internal classes as sealed (SaveContentPageViewModel, ThemeSettingsPageViewModel, MainWindowViewModel, App, HostScreen)
   - Fixed MainWindowViewModel instantiation warning by using RegisterConstant instead of Register in Splat container
   - Excluded tests project from solution temporarily to focus on core functionality
2. Added and implemented FollowSystemTheme property to IThemeService and ThemeService
3. Fixed constructor issues in ThemeSettingsViewModel:
   - Consolidated multiple constructors into a single constructor that properly initializes the base class
   - Ensured all properties are properly initialized in the constructor including ApplyThemeCommand
   - Fixed parameter handling to avoid null reference issues
4. Enhanced ShowDialog implementation in SaveContentView.axaml.cs to handle cases where no parent window is available
5. Fixed ReactiveUI property attribute issue in SaveContentViewModel (removed [Reactive] from HasGameStats)
6. Fixed ViewModelBase inheritance hierarchy to properly implement IRoutableViewModel
   - Updated constructors in derived ViewModels to properly pass IScreen parameter to base class
   - Ensured consistent HostScreen pattern across all ViewModels
7. Implemented proper wrapper ViewModels for ReactiveUI navigation:
   - Created SaveContentPageViewModel and ThemeSettingsPageViewModel
   - Fixed routing by implementing proper IRoutableViewModel inheritance
   - Updated AXAML files to use correct view model bindings with DataContext
8. Fixed event signatures in ThemeService and GameProcessService:
   - Used proper EventArgs-derived classes for event handlers
   - Created ThemeChangedEventArgs and GameProcessStatusEventArgs
9. Fixed AXAML syntax in Views:
   - Changed Items to ItemsSource for ItemsControl
   - Fixed VerticalScrollBarVisibility to ScrollViewer.VerticalScrollBarVisibility
   - Corrected namespace references and XAML attribute formatting
10. Fixed TopLevel to Window conversions in SaveContentView.axaml.cs:
    - Used proper TopLevel.GetTopLevel() pattern for clipboard integration
    - Added null checks to prevent NullReferenceExceptions

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ Move TSK046 from backlog to in-progress in work management
2. ‚úÖ Implement file content loading in SaveContentViewModel using IFileSystemService
3. ‚úÖ Enhance SaveContentView with additional features:
   - ‚úÖ Add search functionality for content exploration
