# Balatro Save and Load Tool Migration - Progress Summary

## Open Items

- Complete UI views implementation (highest priority)
  - DashboardView: Fully functional and styled, supports navigation to SaveContentViewer
  - SaveContentViewer: Initial implementation complete; next, integrate file loading/parsing and structured display
  - Integrate theme switching and user feedback (progress indicators, notifications)
- Implement TSK045 - Enhanced user feedback with progress indicators
- Implement TSK046 - SaveContentViewer functionality (in progress)
- Implement TSK047 - End-to-end testing
- Update US001 once all related tasks are complete

## Next Steps

1. Implement file content loading/parsing in SaveContentViewModel using IFileSystemService
2. Enhance SaveContentView to display structured game data and add search/copy features
3. Integrate progress indicators and notifications for user feedback
4. Test UI on all target platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux)
5. Update documentation and mark completed items as closed

## Next Steps

1. Complete the UI views implementation (in progress)
   - DashboardView supports navigation to SaveContentViewer
   - SaveContentView initial implementation complete
   - Styling has been implemented to match the application theme
   - Theme resources have been expanded to support UI components
2. Enhance user feedback system with progress indicators
3. Implement file loading/parsing and structured display in SaveContentViewer
4. Add end-to-end testing for cross-platform validation

### Current Tasks

- Complete UI views implementation (highest priority)
- Implement TSK045 - Enhanced user feedback with progress indicators
- Implement TSK046 - SaveContentViewer functionality (in progress)
- Implement TSK047 - End-to-end testing
- Update US001 once all related tasks are complete

## Notes

- All implementations have been made cross-platform
- FileSystemService handles platform-specific paths and behaviors
- Theme system is fully implemented with dark/light modes and system theme detection
- Navigation system implemented using ReactiveUI routing
- Project structure follows MVVM pattern with proper separation of concerns
- Dependency injection is configured using Splat
