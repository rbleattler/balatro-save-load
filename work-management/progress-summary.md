### Navigation Service ✓

- Interface defined (INavigationService)
- Implementation complete using ReactiveUI routing
- ViewStackService for view management
- ViewModelBase created for routable ViewModels
- MainViewModel screen host implemented
- ViewLocator for mapping ViewModels to Views
- Sample ViewModels created (DashboardViewModel, ThemeSettingsViewModel)
- DI registration using Splat

### View Models

- MainWindowViewModel implementing IScreen for routing
- DashboardViewModel as initial view
- ThemeSettingsViewModel for theme configuration
- ViewModelBase for common functionality
- ReactiveUI integration with MVVM patterns

### Views

- Basic view structure established
- ReactiveUI view integration
- View activation handlers

## Next Steps

1. Complete the UI views implementation (in progress)
   - DashboardView has been updated with XAML for game status and save file listings
   - Styling has been implemented to match the application theme
   - Theme resources have been expanded to support UI components
2. Fix any compilation warnings in the codebase
3. Continue enhancing the main application layout
4. Complete the save/load functionality and handle error cases
