# Balatro Save and Load Tool Migration - Progress Summary

## Open Items

- Complete UI views implementation (highest priority)
  - DashboardView: âœ… Fully functional and styled, supports navigation to SaveContentViewer
  - SaveContentViewer: ðŸ”„ Initial implementation complete; next, integrate file loading/parsing and structured display
  - Integrate theme switching and user feedback (progress indicators, notifications)
- Implement TSK045 - Enhanced user feedback with progress indicators
- Continue TSK046 implementation - SaveContentViewer functionality (in progress)
  - âœ… Basic UI structure created
  - âœ… ViewModel with reactive properties created
  - âœ… Navigation from DashboardView implemented
  - âœ… TSK046 moved from backlog to in-progress in work management
  - ðŸ”„ Need to implement actual file loading with IFileSystemService
  - ðŸ”„ Need to implement content parsing and structured display
- Fix core codebase compilation issues/warnings (âœ… resolved)
  - âœ… PageViewModelBase, DialogViewModelBase using correct ReactiveUI patterns
  - âœ… SaveFileInfo property required attributes
  - âœ… Event handling with proper EventArgs classes
  - âœ… Code analysis warning suppressions
- Implement TSK047 - End-to-end testing
- Update US001 once all related tasks are complete

## Next Steps

1. âœ… Move TSK046 from backlog to in-progress in work management
2. Implement file content loading/parsing in SaveContentViewModel using IFileSystemService:
   - Use IFileSystemService to read raw file content
   - Parse save file data to extract meaningful game statistics
   - Update UI to display structured data
3. Enhance SaveContentView with additional features:
   - Add search functionality for content exploration
   - Implement content copy capability
   - Improve error handling for invalid save files
4. Integrate progress indicators and notifications for user feedback (TSK045)
5. Test UI on all target platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux)
6. Update documentation and mark completed items as closed
